wellnr-scala-commons
====================

This project contains two common libraries: scala-commons and play-commons. The scala-commons library only contains some general methods and base classes I'm using in several different projects. Just feel free to use it or copy some code for your projects. The play-commons project contains, as the name suggests, several common stuff for play-projects, which will be explained in more detail in the following sections.

In addition to the library projects there is a third project `play-commons-blog` and a related project `play-commons-blog-client` which can be seen as an example project which uses the play-commons library, where as play-commons-blog-client is just an project to play arround with Scala JS.
